## Overview

A **Cantus Firmus** (from Latin "fixed song") is a melody forming the basis of a polyphonic composition. The earliest polyphonic compositions almost always involved a cantus firmus, typically a *Gregorian chant*, a form of sacred song developed mainly in western and central Europe during the 9th and 10th centuries, which invention the popular legend credits to **Pope Gregory the Great**.

**Counterpoint** is the relationship between voices polyphonic compositions. The term originates from the Latin *punctus contra punctum* meaning "note against note". The rules followed by the voices are developed during the Renaissance and in the Baroque era.
One of the most famous polyphonic composer who worked on conterpont was **Giovanni Pierluigi da Palestrina**, who is standing on the right helping you in composing your voices.

## Technical aspects

The most challenging part of this project is the **automatic correction tool**, both of Cantus Firmus and Counterpoint. It is based on a genetic algorithm that, starting from your own composition (or even on a randomic one), it introduces some changes and time to time evaluates the new version, looking for the best one. When a voice whithout mistakes is found, the app provides you the solution and allows you to listen to the new music.
